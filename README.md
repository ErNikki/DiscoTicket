# DiscoTicket

This project is about the development of an Android application called  Disco Ticket,  
an app for the online purchase of tickets for disco clubs.

When in a dance club there is an event or a special guest, for instance a famous DJ,  
in many cases it can be hard to get a ticket for the entrance. Many people who like  
to go to the disco have had the unpleasant experience of going there, only to find out  
there were no more tickets and that they couldn’t enter. Sometimes it can be hard to  
just know where to get tickets in advance, and very often only few night clubs have a  
website for online booking.  

Disco Ticket is an attempt at solving these issues, in fact it aims at allowing people  
to buy tickets for clubs and events in advance; this way, tickets are easy to purchase  
and users are sure there is place for them in the disco. We also implemented a couple  
more functionalities we’ll see in detail later.
